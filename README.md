# ManageStudentsPython

I wrote this piece of code as my first personal projects. It is a application where teachers can manage there students profile (name, class, birthplace and scores). This project may not be good and the code may be inefficient to run, but this is the best I can do at the age of 15.

- login_and_add_students.py: This is the Python code to run the project.

- students_data.txt: This file stores the username and password required for login in.
defaul username: demo\
default password: 12345

## Installation

- I highly recommend you download my project as a .zip file and extract it.
