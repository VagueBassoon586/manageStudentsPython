# ManageStudentsPython
My name is Ho Minh Khoa Nguyen, a high school student in the city of Danang, Vietnam.
I wrote this piece of code as my first personal projects. It is a application where teachers can manage there students profile (name, class, birthplace and scores). This project may not be good and the code may be inefficient to run, but this is the best I can do at the age of 15.


## Files explanation

- login_and_add_students.py: This is the Python code to run the project.
- students_data.txt: This is where students' profiles are store.
- students_data.txt: This file stores the username and password required for login in. (the first line contains the username and the second line contains the password)

## Login in

- defaul username: demo
- default password: 12345


## Features

- Feel free to explore all the features as much as you can. I have tried to make it as users-friendly as possible.


## Installation

- I highly recommend downloading my project as a .zip file and extracting it in a folder (It can only run properly if all the files are in the same folder).
